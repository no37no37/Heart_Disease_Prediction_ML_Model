# Heart Disease Prediction Project Documentation

## Introduction

The "Heart Disease Prediction" project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on various health-related features. This document provides an overview of the project, explaining its purpose, data processing steps, and the machine learning model utilized.

## Purpose

Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality globally. Early detection and prediction of heart disease can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project intends to leverage machine learning techniques to create a predictive model that can assist in identifying individuals at risk of heart disease. The dataset used for this project contains information about individuals' health, lifestyle, and medical history.

## Data Preprocessing

### Uploading and Loading Data

The project starts with uploading a dataset, namely "heart_disease.csv," containing relevant information. The Pandas library is used for data manipulation and analysis. The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for further processing.

### Handling Missing Values

Data quality is crucial for accurate predictions. Missing values are handled by removing rows with null values, ensuring a clean dataset for analysis.

### Feature Engineering

Some features in the dataset are transformed for better compatibility with machine learning algorithms. For example, the 'Gender' column is encoded numerically, replacing 'Male' with 1 and 'Female' with 0.

### Handling Categorical Variables

Certain categorical variables, such as 'prevalentStroke' and 'Heart_Stroke,' are converted into numerical format (0 or 1) to facilitate model training.

### Addressing Class Imbalance

Imbalanced classes, where one class significantly outnumbers the other, can lead to biased models. The Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is employed to balance the distribution of the target variable ('Heart_Stroke').

## Model Training

### Data Splitting

The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. The training set is used to train the logistic regression model, while the testing set assesses its accuracy on unseen data.

### Logistic Regression Model

Logistic regression is chosen as the machine learning algorithm for its simplicity and interpretability. It's well-suited for binary classification problems, such as predicting the presence or absence of heart disease.

### Model Evaluation

The trained model's performance is evaluated using the test set. The accuracy score indicates the proportion of correctly predicted instances.

## Model Deployment

Once satisfied with the model's performance, it is saved using the Pickle library for future use. The saved model file, "Heart_disease_model.pk1," can be deployed in various applications to predict heart disease based on input data.
